CS221 final project
=============

To actually play this:

* python player.py: you can set your own data file if you want to
* Use the asdfjkl;wruo keys, you should be able to hear them properly. To show predictions, press 0. To switch models, use the 1234 keys.
* There is a kolmogorov-smirnov tester which is fairly intuitive to use
* All the graphs are fairly conveniently autogenerated for you, so you can have your own graphs.
